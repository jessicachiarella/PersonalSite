            </div>
            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-center">I'm Jessica, a web developer and creative professional from Chicago, Illinois. I'm the author of two novels via major publishers and have spent the past few years in communications, doing freelance work, and ghostwriting. It was while working at the University of Chicago Law School, however, that I first considered a career shift toward tech. </p> 

<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-center">While at UofC, I was tasked with crafting the school's online Job Search Guide, as well as piloting its Law Careers Blog. I structured the Guide and integrated the the two systems to reach students with pertinent information when they needed it most — to be comprehensive without becoming overwhelming. I now understand it was my first experience in UX/UI design, and the result was one of the office's most effective and often-used resources. </p>

<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-center">When I enrolled in bootcamp, I was elated to discover that many of the skills I draw upon in novel writing — the capacity to organize large systems into smaller components, employ both creativity and logic in problem solving, be exacting when it comes to detail, and always have an eye toward the consumer experience — transferred beautifully to web development. </p>

<p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-center">Not only have I developed the aptitude for object-oriented programming reflected in my resume and sample projects, but now I find the same creative satisfaction in routing API calls as I do in executing plot twists. If I'm not writing code, I'm probably out walking my dog!</p>
